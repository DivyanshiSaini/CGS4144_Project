 Exploration of the Chicken Pituitary Gland
 This data set describes how heat stress can affect the gene expression of the pituitary gland in chickens. There were 708 chickens used in this study, and they were divided into two groups. One group was kept at a controlled temperature and the experimental chicken house maintained a cyclical heat stress scheme.

Question: How does chronic heat stress impact the gene expression profile of the pituitary gland in chickens, and can we identify specific genes or pathways that are significantly altered in response to heat stress?
